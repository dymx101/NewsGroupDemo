# Coding challenge    

We’d like for you to complete the following exercise and submit it to us for review in an email with the project attached as a zip file so that we can better understand your skills. For this exercise, you will be building a simple photo viewing app for iOS. Requirements:    

1. This code test must be written in `Swift 4 or later`.    

2. The deployment target must be `iOS 11+`.    

3. The application must `download and parse the JSON` found at this URL:     
[Mock API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos)

4. Display the images found at the thumbnail key for each node in the JSON, in either a `UITableView` or `UICollectionView`.    



## Extra Credit:     
- Add the ability for the user to `pull to refresh` your initial list view.     
- This code test should represent your best possible work.     
- Your code should be `concise, clear, and reusable` and your user interface should represent your design and product sense.    


The following, in order of importance, will be analyzed when we review your code test:

- Architecture    

- Technical Knowledge    

- Bugs    

- Unit Tests    

- Code Hygiene    

- Documentation    

- Visual Design    


Feel free to use any `third-party libraries` or dependency management systems you’d like.     

You have as much time to complete the exercise as you need, and you will not be judged based on the amount of time it takes you to complete.     

Document any assumptions and add code documentation as you would in a production application.    

We’ll be sure to get in touch after we’ve reviewed your application and provide some feedback even if we decide not to continue the interview.
